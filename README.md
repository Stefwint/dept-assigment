# Dept assigment
Thank you for viewing my Dept assignment. Please read this read-me to get started.

***

# Requirements
There are a couple of things you will need to have installed within your working environment before you can start working with this project.

  * [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) you can use the installer on the Node website to install

***

# Starting the project
To start developing for the frontend, go into the src/ directory of the project and run `npm install` and after that run `npm start`.
It's possible to use yarn instead, but please don't mix npm and yarn.

## JavaScript
The entire frontend is built in React, which is a JavaScript UI Framework. It allows me to write in JSX, which is a JavaScript syntax very similar to HTML but enhanced with the lovely features of JavaScript. JSX should preferrably only ever be written inside .jsx files, not .js files. This way, you can look at the name and extension of a file and have a suggestion about it's contents.

## Styled Components
I will be using styled components to style the components. It's a CSS-in-JS solution that's very popular right now.

## Next.js
I will be using Next.js to get my React code to be able to render server-side. This way we'll have the first render on the server. Which is good for Accessibility, SEO and Performance.
